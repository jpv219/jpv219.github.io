I am a Chemical Engineer with a Master's Degree in Chemical Engineering Research, currently undergoing my last year as a PhD researcher in Matar Fluids Group at the Department of Chemical Engineering at Imperial College London.

My research experience is centered around Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) applied to complex multiphase, surfactant-laden and non-Newtonian flows, particularly focused towards general mixing systems, turbomachinery and flow assurance in a variety of industrial processes. My recent research efforts have been directed towards Machine Learning, and in particular Deep Learning Recurrent Neural Networks aimed at generating predictive models that can complement or supersede costly, high-fidelity CFD models.

I'm an enthusiastic squash player, and I have played for the Men's Elite category team at the Universidad de Los Andes in Colombia from 2017 to 2019, and for the Men's 1st team at Imperial College London, where I was appointed captain for the 23/24 season.
